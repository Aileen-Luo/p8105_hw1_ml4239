#**Problem_1**
##Create a data frame named as problem_1_data_frame
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
set.seed(1)
problem_1_data_frame = tibble(
  uniform_sample = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5),
  vec_logic = uniform_sample > 2,
  vec_character = c("x","y","z","z","z","y","x","z","y","x"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("I","you","she","he", "it", "they", "ze", "he", "xe", "none"))
)
```

##Take the mean of each variable in dataframe 'problem_1_data_frame'.

```{r}
mean(problem_1_data_frame$uniform_sample)
mean(problem_1_data_frame$vec_logic)
mean(problem_1_data_frame$vec_character)
mean(problem_1_data_frame$vec_factor)
```
The mean of random sample and logical vector work.  
The mean of character vector and factor vector do not work.
Because the variables in the last two are not numeric or logical.
